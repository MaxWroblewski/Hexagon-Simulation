# Hexagon-Simulation
## Overview
For many applications, studying the rotational dynamics of irregularly shaped objects can be approximated to a more familiar and symmetric shape. However, in systems which exhibit the tennis racket effect [link to tennis racket effect], we observe that there is often a much more significant dependence on the accuracy of moment of inertia tensor calculations. This heavier dependence on more accurate calculations is further exagurated when an object is highly symmetric about two or three axis [show why this is true].
